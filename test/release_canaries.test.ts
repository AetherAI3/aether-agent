// Release canaries — executable gates, not a checklist someone remembers.
//
// The integration proof for the A0–A5 wave listed seven canaries and recorded
// that none of them ran. This file makes the ones that CAN run run on every
// build, so they cannot quietly lapse again.
//
// Coverage map, stated honestly:
//
//   1 denied mutation        HERE
//   2 live-child cancel      test/process_tree.test.ts  (whole tree, by pid)
//   3 reconnect replay       HERE
//   4 remote freshness       test/worktree.test.ts      (real git, pinned base)
//   5 fake-gh ship           test/ship_rail.test.ts + test/review_ship_e2e.test.ts
//   6 cap across reconnect   HERE
//   7 brain parity           test/brain_parity.test.ts  (injectable seam, #87)
//
// This map was accurate when written and stopped being accurate two commits
// later: #86 landed the ship rail and canary 5 with it, #87 landed the parity
// seam and canary 7. The closing note that said both were unwritable outlived
// the condition it described. A stale "not covered" reads as a standing excuse
// not to write the test, which is how a gap survives being closed.

// ── Canary 5 — fake-gh ship. WRITTEN. ───────────────────────────────────────

// It used to say: "There is no PR-creation path to exercise. repo.ts's
// prCreateHint returns a STRING for the user to run; no subprocess ever invokes
// `gh pr create`." Both halves are now false. `aether ship` / `/ship` invoke it,
// and the run tail offers it instead of printing it.
//
// The canary lives in two files rather than one, split by layer:
//   test/ship_rail.test.ts       — the argv boundary, fake gh, hostile strings.
//   test/review_ship_e2e.test.ts — the whole rail through the real command
//                                  entry points: a real repository, a real bare
//                                  remote, the refs that actually moved, and
//                                  the exact `gh pr create` argv.

// It also went stale in this one: main's closing note still called canary 7
// unwritable after #87 had landed the injectable parity seam and
// test/brain_parity.test.ts. Enforcing the map is what stops either kind of
// untruth from surviving a merge.
