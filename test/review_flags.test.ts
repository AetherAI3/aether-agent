// Every flag the review/ship layer reads must ARRIVE.
//
// main.ts parses with `parseArgs({ strict: false })`. An undeclared flag is not
// an error there and it is not passed through either: it is swallowed into
// `values` under whatever shape parseArgs guesses and stripped out of the
// positionals the command receives. So a command reading an undeclared
// `--files a,b` sees no flag AND no argument — it runs on an empty selection
// and reports success having done nothing. That is not hypothetical: the same
// mechanism is why `aether doctor --live` silently ran the fast report.
//
// These tests assert the PARSED ARGV — what parseArgs produces from the very
// options object main.ts hands it — not any rendered output. A test that
// checked printed text would pass against a command that received nothing and
// printed an optimistic line about it.
//
// The options object is IMPORTED, not scraped out of main.ts's source. Since
// the command-registration seam there is no options literal in main.ts to
// scrape: `CLI_PARSE_OPTIONS` is assembled in cli_registry.ts from the globals
// plus each dispatch-table command's own `flags`. Importing it means this test
// exercises the same table production parses with, so it cannot pass against a
// table that was never wired up.
