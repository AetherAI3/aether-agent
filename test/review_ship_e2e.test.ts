// This is the test the ship rail was missing. Everything below runs against a
// REAL git repository with a REAL bare remote, driven through the actual
// `aether review` / `aether ship` entry points. What it asserts is what ended
// up on disk and in refs — the index git reports, the file content git holds,
// the ref that appeared on the remote, and the exact argv handed to gh — not
// the prose printed around any of it.
//
// gh is faked at the Runner seam rather than on PATH by default: Node refuses
// to spawn a `.cmd`/`.bat` shim without a shell (the CVE-2024-27980 fix), so a
// PATH shim is not portable to Windows. The last test in this file does put a
// real executable `gh` on PATH and drives the default deps, and is skipped on
// win32 — so the PATH form is proven where it can be.
