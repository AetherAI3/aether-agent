// Registering a command in this CLI takes coordinated artifacts, and the
// failure mode when they drift is expensive rather than loud: an entry that is
// described but not dispatched falls through to `cmdChat`, so `aether device
// status` becomes a BILLED chat turn about the words "device status".
//
// The repo's generic guard suites already prove the table is internally
// consistent. What they cannot prove is that THIS lane's entry is present and
// wired to the device handler, which is what this file asserts.
