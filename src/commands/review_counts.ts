// review_counts.ts — how many lines actually changed, per file.
//
// core/review_state.ts answers "which paths changed and in which half"; its
// ChangedFile deliberately carries no line counts. The review screen needs
// them, so they are read here, and read the way the mission requires:
//
//  * ASYNC. The command it replaces (/stage-diff) called execSync three times,
//    which freezes the REPL's key loop for the length of a `git diff` on a big
//    repository. Nothing on this path blocks the event loop.
//  * MACHINE-READABLE. The old code ran `git diff --stat` and recovered the
//    numbers with a regex over the human summary line. `--stat` is a rendering:
//    it abbreviates paths, it is width-dependent, and a binary file's columns
//    are not numbers at all — the old regex turned those into 0.
//  * BOTH HALVES. The old code read `git diff` only, so anything already staged
//    was invisible to a command whose whole job is "show me what I am about to
//    commit". Staged and unstaged are summed here.
//
// A count git did not report stays `null` all the way to the renderer, which
// prints "?". Zero is a claim; null is the truth.
