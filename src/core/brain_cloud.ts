// CloudBrain — the cloud transport. Surfaces the Aether API through the SAME
// BrainEvent vocabulary the local brain emits, so the host renders cloud and
// local runs identically.
//
// Primary path (dev-session protocol): POST /agent/dev/sessions creates a
// server-side coding session; GET .../stream delivers seq-numbered frames
// (tool_call included); the host executes locally and sendToolResult() POSTs
// the result back (idempotent server-side). control() maps pause/resume/steer
// onto POST .../control. This is the real bidirectional round-trip: the API is
// the brain, this machine is the authority — code stays local.
//
// Fallback path (legacy one-way chat stream): when the server has no dev
// route (404) or the feature is off (403), CloudBrain degrades to the
// pre-existing /agent/chat/stream behavior, where sendToolResult/control are
// documented no-ops because the server runs its tools server-side.
//
// That downgrade is NEVER silent. It moves execution off this machine, so it
// always emits a `routing_drift` event first (rendered as a ROUTING_DRIFT
// line, carried structurally under --json), and a run that needs local
// authority (`aether agent`, or an explicit --model) refuses to take it at all
// rather than hand the user a transcript that changed nothing on disk.
