// OllamaBrain — the fully-local brain, in TypeScript (no Python subprocess).
//
// It runs the same agentic chat+tool loop the headless Python brain does, but
// inline: it calls Ollama (core/ollama.ts) with the 8 canonical tools, and on a
// tool_call it emits a {type:"tool_call"} event and AWAITS the host's
// tool_result via sendToolResult — mirroring LocalBrain's queue handoff so the
// host loop (commands/code.ts hostLoop) drives it identically to local/cloud.
//
// The brain DECIDES (emits events); the host RENDERS and EXECUTES every tool
// call, replying with a tool_result. One tool implementation, one path-guard —
// so the local-Ollama path is indistinguishable from cloud by construction.
//
// No new deps: it reuses ollamaChat + the EventQueue. close() aborts the loop.
