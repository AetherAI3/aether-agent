// src/core/handoff.ts — the portable continuation record.
//
// A session log (session_log.ts) is the human's record of one run: append-only
// JSONL plus a rendered monologue, keyed to one absolute working directory on
// one machine. `aether resume` could already REPLAY it to the screen, but the
// brain never saw a byte of it — resuming meant re-typing the story so far.
//
// A handoff is the machine-facing half of that record: a small, self-contained
// JSON document distilled from a session (what the task was, which model ran
// it, what it touched, whether the tests were green, what is still failing)
// plus the repository identity it belongs to. Two things follow:
//
//   1. `aether agent --resume <id> "<next task>"` prepends the CONTINUATION
//      BRIEF built from it, so a different model picks the thread up with the
//      project context already in hand.
//   2. `aether resume export` writes it to a file. Copy that file anywhere —
//      another checkout, another machine, another OS — and
//      `aether agent --resume <file>` continues there. Nothing in it is keyed
//      to an absolute path, so the receiving side needs no matching layout.
//
// Deliberately NOT a transcript: full chat history is large, leaks file
// contents and shell commands, and is exactly what the session log already
// redacts. The brief is a summary a human could have written, which is what
// makes it safe to move between machines.
//
// A handoff read back in is UNTRUSTED input — it arrived from another machine.
// Every field is validated on the way in, and every string is run through the
// terminal sanitizer, because these strings are both printed and prepended to
// the brain's prompt.
