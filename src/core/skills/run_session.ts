// RunSession — the ONE seam where a project's rules and skills enter a real run.
//
// Every surface that drives a brain (the one-shot `aether agent`, the REPL's
// cloud turn, the REPL's local Ollama turn, and the cloud dev-session) opens a
// RunSession and gets exactly three things back:
//
//   headerLines  what the user is told was loaded, and what the policy now is
//   brief(task)  the string the brain reads — rules + skills + host policy + task
//   guard(tool)  the host-side refusal check, run before the tool executes
//
// The brief is composed BEFORE a brain is chosen, so the cloud dev-session
// request body and the local Ollama chat message carry the byte-identical
// string. That is what "one host-loop contract" means here: not two renderers
// that happen to agree today, but one string with two transports.
//
// Two invariants this file exists to hold:
//
//  1. NARROW ONLY. A skill's policy is an intersection applied by the host
//     immediately before execution, and it runs BEFORE the operator permission
//     gate, never instead of it. Nothing declared in a manifest, and nothing
//     written in an instruction file, can add a tool, a permission, or a
//     confirmation the operator session did not already hold.
//  2. NOTHING UNKNOWN RENDERS AS FINE. A dropped instruction source, a
//     truncated rules file, a skipped automatic skill, or an empty effective
//     tool set is stated out loud — in the header AND in the brief.
