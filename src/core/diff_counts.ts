// diff_counts.ts — how much changed, per file, staged and unstaged.
//
// This is repository state, not presentation: "+312 −48" is the headline of a
// review screen, and two implementations of it would disagree the first time
// one of them forgot that a rename spans three NUL fields or that a binary file
// has no line count at all.
//
// It lives BESIDE readRepoState rather than inside it. readRepoState is
// synchronous by contract and every caller depends on that; counting lines wants
// to be async, and forcing an async path into a synchronous module is worse than
// the small separation it would avoid. So this module brings its own async
// runner and nothing else changes.
//
// The rule that shapes the types: a count that does not exist is null, and null
// renders as "?" rather than 0. A binary file has no line count. An untracked
// file is not in any diff, so it has none either. Printing 0 there would be a
// measurement nobody took.
